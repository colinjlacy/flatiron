# Flatiron

A flat-file CMS sending JSON files to an Angular front-end.

The goal of this project was to build a flat-file blog to replace my WP-based blog.  Ultimately it might grow into something more, but for now it's a side-project that I'm using to get more familar with component-based Angular development, and developing in NodeJS via Express.
