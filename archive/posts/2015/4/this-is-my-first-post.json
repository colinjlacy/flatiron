commitment not too long ago to start on a Django project as a way of fulfilling a long-time need, and a way into learning me some Python in the process.  I like MVC, I like what I’ve seen Python do so far, and I don’t like having to pay to keep up with Laravel.  Besides, it’s something new, right?</p><p style=\"color: rgb(119, 119, 119);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">That lasted about a month.  I went from learning some basics in Django, to now ramping up in Ruby and Rails over the course of the next month.  Why?  Because of the classic developer’s dilemma.  <strong>Do I learn what I want?  Or do I learn what just came across my desk.</strong></p><p style=\"color: rgb(119, 119, 119);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">I’ll go ahead an answer that one for you; what had just got dropped on my desk won.  And it wins every time.</p><p style=\"color: rgb(119, 119, 119);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">I’ve been fortunate enough to have been picked up as a part-time instructor for<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span><a title=\"Tech Talent South\" href=\"http://techtalentsouth.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(66, 139, 202);\">Tech Talent South</a>, teaching programming by way of Ruby.  I know programming pretty well.  But Ruby I haven’t touched in a long time.  So the story goes, no doubt.</p><h3 style=\"color: rgb(189, 157,

this year.  They’re all focused entirely around front-end and JS-based technologies.  Create a standard stylesheet library, write Angular modules that we can re-use on various projects, explore a standardized JS unit-test workflow, and the major accomplishment that everyone around the office is waiting for – a Grunt/Protractor integration with Jenkins.  Still, no need for Ruby.  Plenty of time for Python.</p><p style=\"color: rgb(119, 119, 119);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Or so I thought.</p><p style=\"color: rgb(119, 119, 119);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Luck would have it that in the very same week that I was starting to explore the idea of a private Bower registry for my GE office, I would get a call about teaching beginners the ropes using Rails.  At the time, I thought of them as unrelated.</p><p style=\"color: rgb(119, 119, 119);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">I had been looking at<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span><a title=\"this post by Toran Billups\" href=\"http://toranbillups.com/blog/archive/2013/08/04/How-to-host-a-private-bower-registry/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(66, 139, 202);\">this post by Toran Billups</a> that details how a private Bower registry works.  There are also plenty of NodeJS modules that do the same, but unfortunately we don’t have Node up for primetime yet.  That’s another dev’s 2015 goal.  So Python it was going to have to be.</p><p style=\"color: rgb(119, 119, 119);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Well, dropping in Mr. Billups’<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span><a title=\"Django Bower Registry\" href=\"https://github.com/toranb/django-bower-registry\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(66, 139, 202);\">open-source project</a><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>left me with a bit of a problem.  While it accomplished everything it said it would, it left me without the ability to post new items into the private registry.  If only I had known my way around Django, I could have worked with his code, improved it, and maybe even submitted it for a merge.</p><p style=\"color: rgb(119, 119, 119);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">But I don’t.  I don’t know Django very well at all.  And so I almost gave up.</p><p style=\"color: rgb(119, 119, 119);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Then the call came in to start teaching, and after a few talks around the office about Rails and other things to do in Ruby, someone suggested Sinatra.  “What’s that?” I wondered.  I remember that Mr. Billups had mentioned it in his post.  Maybe I should look into it?</p><p style=\"color: rgb(119, 119, 119);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">I woke up that Sunday morning and brewed me a huge pot of coffee.  I pummeled my way through Chris Pine’s<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span><a title=\"Learn to Program\" href=\"https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(66, 139, 202);\">Learn to Program</a> by about 3pm, and then immediately started hounding down Sinatra tutorials.</p><p style=\"color: rgb(119, 119, 119);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">I could go into detail, but I’ll spare you.  There was some rage-coding and a few boxes of Girl Scout Cookies involved.  The outcome was that I learned my way around some Sinatra, successfully started brushing up on Ruby, and even got my own<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span><a title=\"Private Bower on GitHub\" href=\"https://github.com/colinjlacy/private-bower\"

developer I probably should have known better than to declare a desire to learn something when I live and work in an environment that demands constant learning.  How dare I decide where I was going to direct my brain power?  For a brief moment I felt that I had enough control over my world that I could dedicate time and effort to something that had literally nothing to do with the work at hand.  You know, because why not?  But when reality strikes, it is unforgiving.  And so now I’ve been diverted into a totally different direction.  Who knows what will come next?</p>","createdOn":"2015-04-13T02:31:18.647Z","revisedOn":"2015-04-13T02:31:18.647Z"}
